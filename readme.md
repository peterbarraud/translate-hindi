# Word meaning file format
Pipe separated file with a header of (exactly) this format:
```
word|meaning|translation
```
**Notes:**
* To get the word-meaning and the English translation, just put the word
```
<word>
```
* To get only English translation (*no local language meaning*):
```
<word>||
```
### Important:
The translate.py does not do word-meaning. That means, you have to do word-meaning manually.
So, a line like this will not generate meaning of "work":
```
<word>||<translation>
