LaEnsure that Adobe XD is 
1. Launch Adobe XD and open the document that you want to make World Ready
2. Download the plugin from the following location:
3. To install the plugin, simply double-click the ```<file name>.xdx``` file
The setup is done. Now let's look at our document for localization readiness.

# Check if localized strings fit the elements on your Artboards
When you're creating you design, you're probably sizing your elemens to fit the language that you're writing them in. But what about other languages that this document will be localized into?
Let's use World Ready's dododo, to very quickly check our document to localized strings that don't quite fit the elements that we've designed.
1.	With the design open in Adobe XD, select the artboard that you want to test.
**Note**: Select a single artboard on your document.
2.	From the Plugins menu, choose **World Ready**.
3.	In the World Ready dialog, choose a translation service.
**Note:** The Adobe translation service is available out-of-the-box with this plugin. To use the other services, you will need to enter a valid license key for that service.<make some changes here>
4.	From the Mode drop-down list choose Highlight the longest translation.
5.	Then pick one or more of the languages that you want to test your artboard against.
**Note:** World Ready currently supports the listed set of languages.
6. Click Run.
7. Wait for a bit.
If the translated text for any one or more of the languages extends beyond the text elemens in your artboard, you'll see ared bounding box around those elements. And to make things a little more intuitive, World Ready even puts the text for the longest translated strings in the background. So you can see more clearly, what's happened.
8. Now go ahead, resize the elements (or the text).
9. If you're not too sure with the changes you've made, run the test again.
10. If you have more text-based artboards, run the test on those too.

That's it!. You're document is **World Ready**. No need to worry about your vendors complianing about text that doesn't fit after they've done with their localization.

# Preview localized artboards
Create a Preview artboards in other languages and compare them to the ones that you have written.
1.	With the design open in Adobe XD, select the artboard that you want to preview in another language.
**Note**: Select a single artboard on your document.
2.	From the Plugins menu, choose **World Ready**.
3.	In the World Ready dialog, choose a translation service.
**Note:** The Adobe translation service is available out-of-the-box with this plugin. To use the other services, you will need to enter a valid license key for that service.<make some changes here>
4.	From the Mode drop-down list choose Preview Translated ArtBoard.
5.	Then pick one or more of the languages that you want to test your artboard against.
**Note:** World Ready currently supports the listed set of languages.
6. Click Run.
7. Wait for a bit.

Notice that an duplicate arboard was placed on your document, just next to the artboard that you selected. But notice also, that the text in that artboard is translated into the language you selected.
Compare the two artboards. Maybe you just wanted to see what the artboard looks like with the translated text. Clear the Preview artboard after you're done. Or maybe you wanted to share this with a foreign language customer. Save the document to keep the Preview arboards.

# Clear World Ready elements from your document
After you've done using World Ready to check or preview your Artboards, make sure that you clear the World Ready elements off your document.
1. From the Plugins menu, choose **World Ready**.
2. From the Mode drop-down list choose Clear Transactions.
Your document is all cleared up now.
